## Slovenian Computer Museum in Ljubljana (Wed, Dec 16, 2020)

Marko Štamcar will be using this at their non-profit Computer Museum to e-mail Game Boy Camera photos to visitors. https://www.racunalniski-muzej.si/about/

> Our museum will hopefully be opening in Q2/Q3 2021 and we have been planning an interactive exhibit where 2 old-school terminals are connected to allow users to browse through our museum inventory (very similar to https://zbirka.muzej.si/ ). But then I went further and added a webcam-to-ASCII-art option with printout on a real big old-school Fujistu line printer.

> And seeing how these retro terminals make for a fun and simple UI, I then added Game Boy Camera-to-email function this week. We plan to offer both these features in exchange for a small donation to support our non-profit work - I think they will be popular :)
